/**
 * How a turn ended, read by the decision model (feature toggle `turnOutcome`).

 * After a turn completes, the agent's final message is classified as
 * `finished` (did what was asked), `needs_input` (asks the user something or
 * waits for a decision or data) or `blocked` (could not proceed: an error it
 * cannot fix, missing access, a refusal). Only a confident answer counts;
 * anything else is `null` and the caller behaves as before.
 *
 * Callers: SessionManager moves open sessions that need the user to
 * Needs Review; the Tasks Conductor refuses to mark a child node done when it
 * asked for input or gave up (children run unattended, nobody would answer).
